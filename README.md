# crawlwarrant

crawlwarrant verifies which AI crawler is actually at the door and what the site allowed it: identity checks against published IP ranges and signatures, a machine-readable access policy, and a three-bucket audit of access logs (verified and compliant, verified and violating, impostors claiming a crawler's name). This module holds the `robots` package, which parses robots.txt, picks the group that governs a crawler, and applies RFC 9309 matching, returning the rule that decided a path so an audit can say why.

## robots

```go
file, err := robots.Parse(r)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
group, ok := file.Select("ExampleBot")
if !ok {
	fmt.Println("no group names ExampleBot and the file has no * group: everything is allowed")
}
if rule, ok := group.Match("/admin/page"); ok {
	fmt.Printf("%s %q (line %d)\n", rule.Kind, rule.Pattern, rule.Line)
} else {
	fmt.Println("allowed: no rule applies")
}
```

### Groups

A group is the consecutive `User-agent` lines of a record together with the rules that follow them. Every group that names the same product token is merged into one, in file order, as RFC 9309, Section 2.2.1, requires, so a crawler whose rules are split across the file still gets all of them. `Select` compares product tokens case-insensitively and as a whole, never as a substring of a `User-agent` header; when no group names the token the `*` group governs, and when the file has neither the group returned has no rules, which allows every path.

A value that begins with a product token and continues with something else, such as `Googlebot/1.2`, names the group `googlebot` and is reported. A value with no product token prefix, such as `*bot*`, names nothing: it is reported as `non-portable-token`, because it is not an RFC 9309 product token, Google's parser matches nothing, and other crawlers may match substrings.

`Parse` reports what it noticed as findings rather than errors: non-portable values, an `Allow` or `Disallow` line that precedes every `User-agent` line (reported and dropped, never attached to the group that follows), and input past 500 KiB, which is ignored and reported as `truncated` with the byte offset where parsing stopped.

### Matching

Matching follows RFC 9309, Section 2.2.2: the matching rule with the most octets wins, an allow rule wins a tie against a disallow rule of the same length, `*` matches any sequence of octets, a trailing `$` anchors the end, an empty `Disallow` value matches nothing, and `/robots.txt` is always allowed. Pattern and path are compared after percent-encoding normalization, with escapes of unreserved characters decoded and every other escape uppercased.

Run the tests with `go test ./...`.
